1: Byes count as wins
2: first round just do it random
3: make random assignment list
4: make byes part of match assignment
5: try 1000 times to not match school/previous match, then give up - kick it back out to do the whole list over
6: Nobody gets multiple byes
7: Print out results in order (rather than numerical order)
8: Never let same people play twice
9: okay (but not desired) if two people from the same school play, but never play the same person twice
10: always print white on top in matches list
11: Rankings at the end, check ties for having played eachother, then similar opponents
